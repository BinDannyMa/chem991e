### Grading 

Grades will be based on a combination of attendance, class assignments, final project presentation, and the final project. Every Thursday class will be an in-class assignment where we work through a problem together. Bringing a computer is required, if you do not have a laptop please contact me. 	
Attendance	15 %
Class Assignments 	35 %
Presentation	20 %
Final Project 	30 %
