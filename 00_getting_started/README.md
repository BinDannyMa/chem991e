## What is Python?

Python is a programming language. It takes text that you've written (usually referred to as code), turns it into instructions for your computer, and runs those instructions. 

Practically, Python is just another program on your computer. The first thing to learn is how to use and interact with it. There are in fact many ways to do this; the first one to learn is to interact with python's interpreter, using your operating system's (OS) console.

A console (or 'terminal', or 'command prompt') is a textual way to interact with your OS, just as the 'desktop', in conjunction with your mouse, is the graphical way to interact your system. 

##How to use Python
### Opening a console on Mac OS X
OS X's standard console is a program called `Terminal`. Open Terminal by navigating to Applications, then Utilities, then double-click the `Terminal` program. You can also easily search for it in the system search tool in the top right.

The command line Terminal is a tool for interacting with your computer. A window will open with a command line prompt message, something like this:

```bash
mycomputer:~ myusername$
```

###Opening a console on Linux

Different linux distributions (e.g Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint) may have different console programs, usually referred to as a terminal. The exact terminal you start up, and how, can depend on your distribution. On Ubuntu, you will likely want to open `Gnome Terminal`. It should present a prompt like this:

###Opening a console on Windows
It is likely you will need to install Python on Windows

Window's console is called the Command Prompt, named `cmd`. An easy way to get to it is by using the key combination Windows+R (Windows meaning the windows logo button), which should open a `Run` dialog. Then type `cmd` and hit Enter or click `Ok`. You can also search for it from the start menu. It should look like:

```
C:\Users\myusername>
```

Window's Command Prompt is not quite as powerful as its counterparts on Linux and OS X, so you might like to start the Python Interpreter (see just below) directly, or using the `IDLE` program that Python comes with. You can find these in the Start menu.

### Running Python on the Web / Browser
If you would prefer, it is possible to run most of the assignments on a web interface to python such as

This is a fully function version of python, although it might be inconvient to transfer files back and forth.

##Using a code editor
A code editor helps with reading and writing programming code. There are many around, and it is one of the most personal choices a programmer can make - Like a tennis-player choosing their racket, or a chef choosing their favourite knife. To start off with, you'll just want a basic, easy-to-use one that doesn't get in your way, but is still effective at writing python code. Here are some suggestions for those:

[Atom](https://atom.io): Windows, Mac & Linux. A new code editor made by Github. It's an open-source project and is very easy to add functionality for, with its packages system.

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3): Windows, Mac & Linux. A great all around editor that's easy to use. It's Ctl+B shortcut lets you run the python file you're working on straight away.

[Geany](http://www.geany.org/): Windows, Mac & Linux. A simple editor that doesn't aim to be too complicated.

[TextMate](http://macromates.com/): Mac. One of the most famous code editors for Mac, it used to be a paid product but has since been open-sourced.

[Gedit]( https://projects.gnome.org/gedit/) and [Kate](http://kate-editor.org/): Linux. If you run Linux using Gnome or KDE respectively, you might already have one of these two installed!
Komodo Edit: Windows, Mac & Linux. a sleak, free editor based on the more powerful Komodo IDE.
