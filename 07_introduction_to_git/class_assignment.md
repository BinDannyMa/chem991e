Create a **private** git repo and put all the files from `Chem991E/07_introduction_to_git/class_assignment`

Add your partner as a collaborator, and fill in all functions that have a `pass` and a comment.

You must split up this task, with one person doing some of the files and the other one doign the others. 

I will be checking the git log to see that both people contributed

When you are done, instead of emailing me add me as a collaborator and will tell me you are done.
