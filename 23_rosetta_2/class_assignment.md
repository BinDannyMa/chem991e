Part 1 & Part 2

1) Write submission script to run rosetta's ab initio prediction aglorithm using the pdb and fragment files supplied

 - each run should predict 100 structures 

 - each job run should have a max run time of 12 hours 

 - should be a total of 10 runs 

2) run all 10 jobs 

3) Follow the lecture and recreate both the plot and the ray traced image of the clusters. Put both images and the submission script on github repo or email it to me.

REMEMBER location of files matters you are always running things 2 directories forward.
